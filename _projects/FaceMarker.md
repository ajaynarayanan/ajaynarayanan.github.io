FaceMarker is an automated android student attendance marking system using facial recognition. I worked on this as part of my undergraduate's design project.

FaceMarker encompasses deep convolutional neural networks (MTCNN and Inception Resnet v1 (IR50)) for real-time face detection and recognition. MTCNN is used for face detection and IR50 is used to generate embedding for the detected faces. Further, an SVM classifier is used to recognize the face images from the generated embedding with a pre-defined database of student face images. FaceMarker includes a feature of mailing the daily attendance report to the faculty for easy attendance record maintaining.
