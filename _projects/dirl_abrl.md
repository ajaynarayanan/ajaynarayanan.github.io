#### Problem Definition
_RGB-IR Cross Modality Person Re-Identification_ (reID) comes under the field of computer vision and the problem has the requirement of matching a person across multiple camera views either from overlapping/non-overlapping cameras of RGB or Infrared (IR) modalities.

#### Approach
We propose two solutions methods - **A**ttribute **B**ased **R**epresentation **L**earning
(ABRL) and **D**omain **I**nvariant **R**epresentation **L**earning (DIRL) based on novel loss
functions (attribute classification loss and domain classification respectively) along with
re-ranking for the task of RGB-IR cross modality person reID. We make use of manually annotated common pedestrian attribute information for two large-scale RGB-IR reID datasets as part of ABRL.
