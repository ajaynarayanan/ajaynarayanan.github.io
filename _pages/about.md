I'm a data engineer at [Navis](https://www.navis.com), currently working on machine learning applications in shipping terminal operations. I completed my Bachelor's from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Kancheepuram ([IIITDM Kancheepuram](http://www.iiitdm.ac.in)). 

My research interests lie in the field of machine learning and deep learning. I am interested in the explainability, interpretability and fairness of machine learning models. Iâ€™m also keen to explore the applications of ML/DL in various domains (computer vision tasks, supply chain logistics, etc.).

In my free time, I enjoy hitting the gym, cycling and speedcubing.
