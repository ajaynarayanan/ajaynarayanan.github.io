I'm a first-year graduate student at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/), pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

Before my graduate studies, I was a data engineer at [Navis](https://www.navis.com) for two wonderful years (2020-2022). There, I worked on machine learning applications in shipping terminal operations. I completed my Bachelor's from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Kancheepuram ([IIITDM Kancheepuram](http://www.iiitdm.ac.in)) in 2020. 

My research interests lie in the field of machine learning and deep learning. I am interested in the explainability, interpretability and fairness of machine learning models. Iâ€™m also keen to explore the applications of ML/DL in various domains (computer vision tasks, supply chain logistics, etc.).

In my free time, I enjoy hitting the gym, cycling and speedcubing.
